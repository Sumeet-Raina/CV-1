I am a self-motivated, fast-learning graduate from Makers Academy with an experienced background in Merchandising. After finding my passions in software development, Makers has equipped me with the skills I need to turn curiosity and creativity into a disciplined, deliberate process for building Software, comfortably and efficiently learning and exploring technologies new to me, working in an AGILE way, and growing in my role as a Software Developer.

A 7 year career in Merchandising gave me not only a solid foundation in data analytics and problem-solving, but also key business skills, a client-side working ethic, professional communication and managerial skills, and the ability to cope under pressure. It has also given me the means to feel comfortable with myself and other in a business environment, to bring a certain element of authenticity and a humbled approach to a professional role.

I am extremely excited to progress in my career as a Software Developer, to build on real-life projects and continue to learn and grow within Tech. My interests are in tech for good, problem solving real world challenges, thoughtful design and increasing my breadth of knowledge.
